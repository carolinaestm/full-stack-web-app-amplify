# Full-Stack Web Application with AWS Amplify
## Overview
In this project, I learned how to create a simple full-stack web application using AWS Amplify. I built and hosted a React application on AWS, used Amplify to add authentication, data, and a serverless function to capture the signed-up user's email and save it in the database. Then, I implemented a frontend for the app that integrates with the cloud resources.

## What I Accomplished
In this project, I:

- Hosted: Built and deployed a React application on the AWS global content delivery network (CDN).
- Authenticated: Added authentication to the app to enable sign-in and sign-out functionality.
- Database: Integrated a real-time API, database, and a serverless function.
- Function: Implemented a lambda function that is triggered when a user signs up to the app.
  
## This application uses the following AWS services:

- AWS Amplify: To simplify the development and deployment process.
- GraphQL API: To manage real-time data and interactions.
- AWS Lambda: To handle serverless functions.
- Amazon DynamoDB: For database management.
